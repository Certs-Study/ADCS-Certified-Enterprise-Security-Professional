### UnPAC the Hash

UnPAC the Hash is a technique primarily used in cybersecurity to extract Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) password hashes from Active Directory environments.&#x20;

This process assists in identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities by analyzing the extracted hashes for weak or compromised credentials.&#x20;

By "unpacking" these hashes, security teams can effectively monitor and enhance their network's security posture against credential theft and lateral movement attacks.
