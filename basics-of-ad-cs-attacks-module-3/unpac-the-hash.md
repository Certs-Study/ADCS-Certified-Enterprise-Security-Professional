### UnPAC the Hash

UnPAC the Hash is a technique primarily used in cybersecurity to extract Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) password hashes from Active Directory environments. This process assists in identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities by analyzing the extracted hashes for weak or compromised credentials. By "unpacking" these hashes, security teams can effectively monitor and enhance their network's security posture against credential theft and lateral movement attacks.
